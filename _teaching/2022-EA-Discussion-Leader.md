**Role:** Discussion Leader

**Course Description:** 
From the Effective Altruisim at UVA [website](https://ea-uva.org/)    

Effective Altruism is a philosophical and social movement focused on answering one question: *How can we best help others?*   

Our resources are limited, so we have to use them wisely. Effective Altruism is about:  
1. **Using evidence and reason to find the most promising causes to work on**
2. **Taking action by using our time and money to do the most good we can**
