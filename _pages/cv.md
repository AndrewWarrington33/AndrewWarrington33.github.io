*Research Assistant II - [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Lab](https://aim.hms.harvard.edu/)*

* Conducted large-scale genomic and clinical analyses (GWAS, AI-driven clinical phenotyping) across MGB Biobank, radiation oncology, healthy volunteer, and geriatric cohorts.

* Built and deployed facial biomarker pipelines (FaceAge, FacePhenoAge, FaceSurvival) using ViT-based transfer learning with leakage-free validation and external cohort testing to advance AI-derived biomarkers of aging and longevity.

* Developed a Flask-based web app with REDCap/Dropbox integration, secure photo pipelines, Dockerized deployment, and background task orchestration.

* Engineered multi-stage pipelines for cohort curation, data harmonization (labs, dose metrics, temporal alignment), and automated REDCap/Dropbox workflows supporting clinical research.

* Authored and revised IRB protocols, consent forms, and operational documentation; independently managed 7 IRB-approved protocols across MGB and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.

* Initiated and independently managed recruitment, consent, and administration of screening tools for the interventional Lung-GAP trial in geriatric lung cancer patients (NCT06987890
).
