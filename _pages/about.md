This is the home page of Andrew Warrington's personal website.

Biography
---------
I was born and raised in Northern Virginia. I attended the University of Virginia where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science with majors in Biology and Psychology. Shortly after graduation, I moved to Boston and began working at the Center for Cancer Genomics within the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Lab.

Research Interests
------------------

I hope to pursue a PhD in either Biostatistics or Computational Biology. 

Hobbies
-------
I enjoy reading, running, lifting weights, and cooking. I am an avid fan of film - especially any of Denis Villeneuve's work.
